      <div class="content">

        <p>The battle of Bautzen was one of the last successful/victorious Wermacht tank-offensive battles, fought in
          the Eastern front during WW2. <br>

            alt="Battle of Bautzen">
          <br>
          The battle started in 23 and raged on for days until the 28 April. By then the Polish 2nd army, Soviet 52nd
          army and the 5th guards army had been engaging in close combat street fights with the remnants of the German
          army group center, that includes the 17th army and 4th panzer. <br>

          Prelude<br>
          <br>
          The Germans had what was left of the 4th Panzer Army. For the battle the Germans had two armored divisions and
          (the 20th and another named Hermann Göring) and two mechanized divisions (Brandenburg and Hermann Göring 2)
          two infantry Divisions (the 17th and 545th Volksgrenadier division). The total amount of soldiers was
          estimated to be around 50,000 soldiers, 300 tanks and 600 guns.<br>

          4th Panzer Army, with a Panzer IV in the background <br>
          <br>
          The Polish 2nd army consisted of (5th, 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th), around 84,000 to 90,000 men and 500 tanks. The
          problem was that many of these men was new recruits, inexperienced to combat and incorporated from the newly
          gained territories. The main problem was the officer cadre. In 1944 the Polish people army estimated to have
          one officer for each 1,200 soldiers, and many of these officers in the Polish army were Soviet officers of
          Polish decent. <br>
          <br>
          Overall the German units were fewer in numbers than the Polish army, and the Germans supplies were worn out.
          But Polish sources describe the Germans as more experienced (the same army had been in Stalingrad and was used
          to urban warfare, tactic and strategies). The Germans managed to put inexperienced soldiers from the
          Hitlerjugend and Volkssturm units. <br>
          <br>
          Background <br>
          <br>
          In the last months of WW2, the Polish 2nd army, under general Karol Świerczewski, took part in the Soviet
          drive on Berlin. They were part of the Marshal Ivan Konev's 1st Ukrainian Front. The Poles operated in the
          centre and was flanked by the Soviet 5th Guards army on the right, and the 7th mechanized Corps to the left.

          Against the Polish forces was the 4th Panzer Army, under general Fritz-Hubert Gräser of Ferdinand Schörners
          Army group Center. <br>

          April 17th, the Polish 2nd army breached the defenses of the Germans around Weisser Schöps and Neisse. The 2nd
          Polish army's pursuit of the retreating German forces pushed the Germans towards Dresden, and in turn,
          threatened to cut off additional forces in the Muskauer Forst region. The heavy pursuit after the Germans was
          a success. On 18 and 19 April, parts of the 2nd Polish army (the 8th Infantry Division and 1st Armored Corps)
          engaged the Germans and pushed them back while the remaining 5th, 7th, 9th and 10th Infantry Divisions pushed
          into Dresden. This made it possible to destroy the remaining Germans in the Muskauer Forst. <br>
          <br>
          The 20th of April was another successful attack, but this time by the 7th mechanized corps caotures parts of
          Bautzen, and trapping several German formations as well. <br>
          <br>
          Battle <br>
          <br>
          On 21 April, a big gap had formed due to the Pollish 1st armored Corps pushing towards Dresden and the
          infantry units (8th and 9th infantry Divisions) as well as the Polish units that which was securing the
          Muskauer Forst region. <br>
          <br>
          The 7th and 10th infantry Divisions were engaged near Neisse and the 5th infantry Division as well as the 16th
          tank brigade were in transit between those two groups of 7th and 10th. <br>
          <br>
          The Polish unit was stretched over a line of 50 kilometers which the Germans new all about and took the
          opportunity presented to them and pushed hard into the gap that was made between the Polish 7th and 10th
          infantry Divisions.<br>
          <br>
          The 21 of April marked the beginning of the battle of Bautzen. In the west the 20th Panzer Division started to
          move forward on Bautzen, while the 17th infantry Division to the east advanced on Niskey and Weißenberg. Along
          the way was still pockets of Germans trapped by the advancing Polish army and the Germans freeing a number of
          trapped Germans and adding them to the offensive that was on its way. <br>
          <br>
          The Germans pushed in between the Polish 2nd army and the Soviet 52nd army that was located around Bautzen, 40
          kilometers North East of Dresden and 25 kilometers west of Görlitz sweeping Soviet units a long the way. <br>
          <br>
          Polish general Świerczewski continued with his attempt to take Dresden, but made it worse and the growing
          chaos was now spreading to the entire Polish army, as many communication lines were cut.<br>
          <br>
          The Germans succeeded to link up with what was left of the troops in Maskauer Forst, and managed to throw the
          Polish and the Soviet forces into chaos.<br>
          <br>
          The Polish 2nd army split itself into 4 different groups and many found themselves surrounded by Germans. The
          worst was for the 5th infantry Division and 16th tank brigade, as they were struck in the rear, suffering
          severe losses. Especially the 16th tank brigade. The unit was almost annihilated, losing over 90 percent of
          its personnel and only 100 managed to survive.<br>
          <br>
          The retreating Soviet and Polish units in a small village of Niederkaina, which is today a part of Bautzen,
          set a barn on fire, which contained between 196 and 300 captured German members of the Volkssturm. <br>
          <br>
          <img class="img-fluid" src="../startbootstrap-simple-sidebar/article_images/Volkssturm.jpeg" alt="Volkssturm">
          <br>

          The Volkssturm, the last third Reich militia <br>
          <br>
          Świerczewski haltered his forces that was advancing to Dresden and ordered to pull back and secure the breach
          the Germans had effectively used. The 22nd of April he ordered the 1st armored Corp to change direction to
          abandon Dresden and instead support the center. The 8th infantry was also recalled but the 9th was remained
          near Dresden.<br>
          <br>
          The lack of communication made marshal Konev angry and Świerczewski was relieved of his command for
          incompetence. Marshal Konev ordered eight divisions from the Ukrainian front to reinforce the Polish
          positions, to stabilize the situation. <br>
          <br>
          The German attack to the southeast of Bautzen was a success. And at the same time, the 20th Panzer division
          was able to attack the trapped units in the south of Bautzen. Coordinations with the trapped Germans inside
          Bautzen made it possible to break into the town. A quick assembled Polish counter attack was without a success
          and resulted in recapturing of the whole Bautzen after several days of bloody house to house combat. During
          the next day's several pockets of resistance was cleared by the victorious German troops. Outside the town of
          Bautzen, the German advance stalled, because of the lack of fuel and supplies. <br>
          <br>
          The recapture of Bautzen was one of the last successful German tactical victories on the Eastern Front.

        <p>Background <br>
          <br>
          Harvard University chemist Louis Fieser developed napalm in 1942. <br>

          The first use of napalm was by U.S against Japan in WWII. The true goal was to use it as a weapon to burn down
          buildings and on infantry as well (civilians was garantuee to be hit). The U.S continued to use the napalm in
          the Korean war and Vietnam, and the latter war, was making headlines with a famous Vietnam photo “the
          screaming girl”. <br>
          <img class="img-fluid" src="../startbootstrap-simple-sidebar/article_images/screamingGirl.jpeg"

          This shows a group of children screaming and running away. The girl in the middle was hit by napalm and the
          burned areas visible on her right arm. <br>
          <br>
          Because of this picture, a lot of documentaries have been made, advocating to ban the use of napalm. This
          specific girl in the picture survived and lives a healthy life till this day in Canada. <br>
          <img class="img-fluid" src="../startbootstrap-simple-sidebar/article_images/burnedgirl.jpeg" alt="burnedgirl">
          <br>

          This is the same girl from the first picture. <br>
          <br>
          What is napalm? <br>
          <br>
          Napalm is a flammable liquid used in warfare. The U.S was the first one using napalm in war and are still one
          of the few using it today against military targets. <br>
          <br>
          Napalm got it name from the two chemicals in it's composition: Naphthenic acid and Palmitic acid. It sticks to
          the skin and makes catastrophic burns for the victim, especislöy when it catches fire. <br>
          <br>
          <img class="img-fluid" src="../startbootstrap-simple-sidebar/article_images/napalm.jpeg" alt="napalm">
          Napalm bomb used in the Vietnam war. American soldiers at the front. <br>
          <br>
          Although the napalm is in my opinion inhumane, it is still allowed to be used in wars. Although the use on
          civilians targets was outlawed by the United Nations Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons in 1980. The
          U.S still uses it as a weapon against military targets. <br>
          <br>
          New composition of Napalm B <br>
          <br>
          Modern napalm is used as napalm B. It is different than the older version of napalm that was used during WWII,
          Korean and Vietnam war. Napalm B uses different t chemicals, it uses plastic polystyrene and hydrocarbon
          benzene. These ingredients combined, creates jellied gasoline, which naturally is extremely flammable and hot
          when ignited. Napalm B is easier to control than the previous napalm, because previous napalm was so unsecure
          and flammable that if a soldier smoked near it, it caught on fire. However, despite the different
          characteristics, napalm B is often referred to as simply as “napalm”. <br>
          <br>
          The other difference with napalm B is that it burns a lot longer than the older version. It can burn for as
          long as 10 minutes, while the older version only lasted for 30 seconds. <br>
          <br>
          Napalm as a weapon <br>
          <br>
          Napalm B is a incendiary weapon. It can cause fires, extreme burns and explosions, all in one. It can also
          lead to asphyxiation (suffocation) to those close to the detonation point. The unique thing with napalm is
          that it sticks to the skin of people and is hard to remove even when it is burning. <br>
          <br>
          The typical way of using the napalm B is to destroy bunkers, trenches and shelters as well as foxholes. One
          bomb can destroy an area of 2,500 square yards. <br>

          The German soldiers started by putting candles on their trenches and decorating their trees, and continuing by
          singing Christmas carols. The British, in their turn, sang their own carols. <br>
          <br>
          They continued to exchange wishes for a happy Christmas. <br>
          <br>
          The Germans shouted out in their broken English, “A happy Christmas to you, Englishmen!!” and heard back “Same
          to you, Fritz, but dinna o’er eat yourself wi’ they sausages!” Shortly thereafter, the soldiers from the both
          sides ventured into no man’s land to exchange food and small gifts like buttons and hats. The artillery in
          that region fell silent that night. The Christmas truce allowed soldiers to attend to their fallen comrades
          behind the front line. Joint services were held. However, the fraternization was not without its risks - some
          soldiers were shot by the opposing forces. In many sectors, the truce lasted only through Christmas night, but
          in some areas it was extended until New Years Day. <br>
          <br>
          Bruce Bairnsfather, who served in the British army, wrote “I wouldn’t have missed that unique and weird
          Christmas day for anything… I spotted a German officer, some sorts of lieutenant I should think, and being a
          bit of a collector, I intimated to him that I had taken a fancy to some of his buttons… I brought out my wire
          clippers and, with a few deft snips, removed a couple of his buttons and put them in my pocket. I then gave
          him two of mine in exchange… The last i saw was one of my machine gunners, who was a bit of an amateur
          hairdresser in civil life, cutting the unnaturally long hair of an enemy soldier, who were patiently kneeling
          on the ground whilst the automatic clippers crept up the back of his neck”. <br>
          <br>
          General Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien, commander of the British II Corps, was furious when he heard what was
          happening, and forbade friendly communication with the opposing German troops. <br>

          N. A. Vdovkin, Sotnik of the 1st Orenburg Cossack Regiment, recalled how he commanded the mounted heading to
          the Rimanov village in Galicia. The enemy had taken some high ground nearby. After a skirmish, the Cossacks
          stealthy aproached a cabin guarded by Austrian soldiers. The scouts broke into the cabin and captured up to 30
          enemy soldiers and officers without firing a single shot. They sent the captives to the village and placed
          them in an empty house. The Cossacks were feeding their horses when one of the soldiers told Vdovkin that a
          captive wanted to speak to him. <br>
          <br>
          Vdovkin agreed. <br>
          <br>
          A tall, broad-shouldered captive entered the house and asked Sotnik to let him go home for a while. <br>
          <br>
          “Let you go home?” Vdovkin asked in surprise <br>
          <br>
          “Yes home!” <br>
          <br>
          “Are you out of your mind?” <br>
          <br>
          “No, Sir. It’s right around the corner…” the captive mumbled <br>
          <br>
          “What’s around the corner?” Sotnik asked <br>
          <br>
          “My house, where my elderly mother lives. Please let me go, we’re celebrating the Mass of Christ tomorrow”. <br>
          <br>
          “The Mass of Christ? You mean Christmas?” <br>
          <br>
          “Yes! Yes! Christmas! So what do you say, Sir? The captive continued <br>
          <br>
          “What is your name?” <br>
          <br>
          “Joseph” replied the sergeant major, clasping his hands. “Like St. Joseph, Husband of Mary.” <br>
          <br>
          “You may go!” permitted Vdovkin. “Go but remeber, Mr. Joseph, if you don’t return, you will fail me. And your
          lie may provoke the Virgin Mary to anger…” <br>
          <br>
          Sotnik Vdovkin didn’t regret his decision. Sixty years later, he would remember how the sergeant major
          returned back into captivity that same morning and how they met again in Tavriya during the Civil War, where
          Joseph was together with his wife and daughter. His family prayed for Sotnik Vdovkin every Christmas Eve. <br>

          In the evening of December 24, 1914, British soldiers saw that something strange was happening in the front
          line near Ypres: the enemy trenches were decorated with an ocean of small candles. The German soldiers started
          to sing Stille Nacht, Heilige Nacht (a Christmas carol written by Joseph Mohr and Franz Gruber in 1818). The
          British listened to the end of the song and then sang themselves. The Germans greeted them with thunderous
          applause. <br>
          <br>
          In other parts of the front line, German and English soldiers left their trenches, exchanged souvenirs and
          food, sang Christmas carols, and attended to their fallen. <br>
          <br>
          However, the Christmas truce was held mainly by British and German units. The French were less inclined to
          fraternize with invaders due to the fact that Germans were occupying their homeland and turning a great many
          of their villages and cities into ruins. <br>
          <br>
          The authorities reactions to the Christmas fraternization was different. The British newspaper published
          numerous letters that soldiers sent to their families, telling them about the miracelous truce. Both leading
          national newspapers, The Daily Mirror and Daily Sketch, printed photographs of British and German troops
          fraternizing with each other. The tone of the report was mainly positive. Meanwhile, the German newspaper did
          not cover the event, all letters from the front were severly cencored, and soldiers were forbidden to write
          about the truce. The French press reported that all cases of fraternazation happened only in those sectors
          along the front where the British and German faced each other, and French soldiers did not take part in them
          at all. <br>

          Celebratory Gunfire on New Year's Eve <br>

          <br>

          Of all war-time New Year celebrations by Ivan Denisovich Shastun, the most memorable is the one from 1945. The
          previous year had not provided a chance for any celebration - the liberation of Cherkasy was instantly
          followed by fierce and violent battles for the city of Smila near the Tiasmyn River. <br>
          <br>
          After the capitulation of Romania, Shastun with his comrades reached Poland and occupied a small foothold on
          the river Visla, some 10 kilometers away from the front line. The temperature dropped to 30–35 degrees and the
          soldiers had to pound the stone ground to create dugouts. <br>
          <br>
          They made three ground swells, set up a stove and started hearing it up. Everyone gathered around it and
          wished for a happy New Year and prompt to victory. <br>
          <br>
          After that, there was some celebratory Gunfire; everyone went outside and fired every kind of weapon they had.
          That's how the year of Victory began. <br>
          <br>
          Soon after that, the commander of the 1st Ukrainian front ordered an advance. Shastun was a battery commander
          of the 373rd Rifle Division. The Elbe and Victory day followed, and it's hard to imagine the joy of those
          days, as well as the overall excitement and jubilation. However, the artillery unit had one more destination -
          Prague. <br>

          Christmas at a Depth of 20 Meters <br>
          <img class="img-fluid" src="../startbootstrap-simple-sidebar/article_images/depth.jpeg" alt="Christmas at depth">
          <br>

          From the U-123 submarine log record, commander Reinhard Hardegen: <br>
          <br>
          “Christmas on board in the Bay of Biscay. All compartments were provided with artificial for trees decorated
          with electric lights. Following the holiday ceremony and dinner, the letters and presents from home were
          distributed among the crew. The celebration continued in compartments filled with Christmas songs.” <br>
          <br>
          However, the book by Michael Gannon provieds more vivid witness recollections. They reveal some facts that
          show the importance of celebration in routine life of German submarines. So, the person involved provided
          their own version. <br>
          <br>
          The U-123 commander was expecting to celebrate Christmas on the base, but received the order to get ready to
          set off. However, he managed to prepare for the celebration on board. The captain developed a cunning plan
          that could raise the spirits of the crew members who were not happy with the U-boat expedition happening right
          before Christmas. After the first day, at noon on December 24, the commander ordered a quick dive. Once the
          submarine reached a Depth of 20 Meters, he used a speakerphone to congratulate the U-123 crew. <br>
          <br>
          When they heard “Captain speaking”, the submariners tensed up, waiting for important information about their
          mission, but the worry on their faces soon gave way to amusement. <br>
          <br>
          Hardegen informed everyone that the submarine crew was celebrating Christmas, and the submarine would spend
          some hours at depth to avoid any disturbances. He said he wanted to make it as festive as possible on a
          submarine. All off-duty crew members were invited to the central control compartment. <br>
          <br>
          When the crew gathered, they learned that intendants had fir trees for every compartment, and the sergeant
          would start distributing them soon. The largest fir tree was meant for the control center, and the
          electricians would decorate it with electric lights. Moreover, the submariners were told that the navigator
          hade managed to get some cakes, and the cook was making a pie. <br>
          <br>
          There were more surpeises in the store though. The captain announced that after dinner, deck officer Horst von
          Schroeter would hand out gifts and letters from home, as he temporarily assumed the responsibilities of Knecht
          Ruprecht (a companion of saint Nicholas). “But remember,” Hardegen said jokingly, “if you were a bad boy, you
          will be punished!” <br>
          <br>
          The captains idea worked well, as the very news about gifts and celebration encouraged the crowd. <br>

          I Have Never Tried Patties Like This Before <br>

          <br>

          Timofey Kutigin recalls the new years celebration of 1944. Their comrade, Kontantsin Kontantsinovich Argutin,
          a Caucasian native in his late fifties, used to boast that he had solid cooking experience in almost every
          restaurant in Pyatigorsk and Nalchik. He obtained some flour at the Depot to mix the dough, and used mackerel
          and pease porridge from the daily rations as stuffing for festive baked patties. <br>
          <br>
          After that he made a stove in the dug-out and started baking. <br>
          <br>
          Other soldiers followed the smell that reminded them of home and crowded around the dug-out. <br>
          <br>
          Sometime before midnight, the radio operation ordered the unit to battle. Everyone rushed to their posts, when
          suddenly the battalion commander said “Dear comrades, best wishes for the new year of 1944. I hope everybody
          returns home and that the war will soon be over. Get ready to launch some “fireworks”! Three quick shots at
          the enemy, fire!” <br>
          <br>
          After this celebration, the unit returned to the trenches. Kutygin, as a party organizer, was given a short
          speech, when the enemy decided to return the favor and congeulated the soldiers with “fireworks” of their own.
          Someone used a ground sheet to cover the parties from falling to the dirt. The bombardment ended, and the
          soldiers had a proper dinner. Even the divisions paper had a note about this celebration. Kutygin liked to say
          that he had never tried patties like it before. <br>
          <br>
          Christmas Football <br>
          <img class="img-fluid" src="../startbootstrap-simple-sidebar/article_images/fotball.jpeg" alt="Fotball war truce">
          <br>

          By Christmas morning, the neutral ground was filled with sociable soldiers who were sharing presents and
          rations and singing songs together. Some used this Christmas truce to find their fallen comrades and lay them
          to rest due respects, which was hardly possible under heavy fire. <br>
          <br>
          Soon after that, some improvised balls were ready, and a football match started. <br>
          <br>
          A mutual understanding and lack of fear put the British Soldiers at ease, and they started playing football.
          Eventually, the German soldiers were challenged to a full-scale match. Both sides formed their teams and
          discussed the rules. <br>
          <br>
          The players tried to follow the football rules of that time. Two boulders served as an improvised goal.
          Germany won 3–2 that day. <br>

          Christmas in the Vosges <br>
          <img class="img-fluid" src="../startbootstrap-simple-sidebar/article_images/vosges.jpeg" alt="Vosges">
          <br>

          German officer Richard Schirrmann shares his memories of 1915. The territory near the Bernhardstein in the
          Vosges (a mountain group of the north-east of France) was occupied by German and French troops who were
          separated by a narrow no-mans-land. He described the landscape as “a wilderness of earth and strewn with
          shattered trees and roots, the ground ploughed up by shellfire.” <br>
          <br>
          But the enemies ceased fire on Christmas Eve night. <br>
          <br>
          Schirrmann recalled that when the Christmas bells had rung in the Vosges, the German and French forces had
          felt something opposite to hostility. <br>
          <br>
          They stopped fighting and made improvised hostels, using abandoned trenches to visit each other and exchange
          their local goods for Westphalian brown bread, cookies, and ham. The officer says they were so happy back then
          that they remained good friends even after Christmas was over. <br>
          <br>
          That occasion gave Schirrmann the idea to create hostels, cheap hotels for young people, where they could stay
          for a night or two and socialize. <br>

          Celebrating a Peaceful New Year <br>
          <img class="img-fluid" src="../startbootstrap-simple-sidebar/article_images/peace.png" alt="Peaceful Christmas">
          <br>

          Anatoly Fedorovich Zarva remembers the New Year celebration in 1944. The 1st Guards Tank Army was visited by
          its commander, general Katukov, accompanied by a member of the Military Council, general Popel. They
          congratulated the military personnel and rewarded the soldiers for their distinguished service in heavy
          battles. The 20th Guards Motor Rifle Division, where Zarva served, were defending, but the situation on the
          front was relatively peaceful that day. The soldiers enjoyed a unique opportunity to celebrate a peaceful New
          Year. <br>
          <br>
          A real surprise was waiting for them: the menu was significantly extended. Everybody received a chocolate bar,
          a few apples, and a glass of milk as New Year gifts. Milk was something beyond dreams, because the tankers did
          not see it often during wartime. <br>
          <br>
          In the early morning of January 1, while the German soldiers were asleep , the Commander of the 20th Motor
          Rifle Division ordered his men to form up, congratulate everyone, and wished them a happy New Year. <br>
          <br>
          Sometime later, the German positioned themselves in front of the Soviet forces and joined the celebration by
          singing “Katyusha”, a song they took a liking to at the very beginning of the war.
