      <button type="button" class="collapsible">The last successful German victory</button>
      <div class="content">
        
        <p>The battle of Bautzen was one of the last successful/victorious Wermacht tank-offensive battles, fought in
          the Eastern front during WW2. <br>
          <img class="img-fluid" src="../startbootstrap-simple-sidebar/article_images/BattleofBautzen.png" alt="Battle of Bautzen">
          <br>
          The battle started in 23 and raged on for days until the 28 April. By then the Polish 2nd army, Soviet 52nd
          army and the 5th guards army had been engaging in close combat street fights with the remnants of the German
          army group center, that includes the 17th army and 4th panzer. <br>

          Prelude<br>
          <br>
          The Germans had what was left of the 4th Panzer Army. For the battle the Germans had two armored divisions and
          (the 20th and another named Hermann Göring) and two mechanized divisions (Brandenburg and Hermann Göring 2)
          two infantry Divisions (the 17th and 545th Volksgrenadier division). The total amount of soldiers was
          estimated to be around 50,000 soldiers, 300 tanks and 600 guns.<br>
          <br>

          <br>
          The Polish 2nd army consisted of (5th, 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th), around 84,000 to 90,000 men and 500 tanks. The
          problem was that many of these men was new recruits, inexperienced to combat and incorporated from the newly
          gained territories. The main problem was the officer cadre. In 1944 the Polish people army estimated to have
          one officer for each 1,200 soldiers, and many of these officers in the Polish army were Soviet officers of
          Polish decent. <br>
          <br>
          Overall the German units were fewer in numbers than the Polish army, and the Germans supplies were worn out.
          But Polish sources describe the Germans as more experienced (the same army had been in Stalingrad and was used
          to urban warfare, tactic and strategies). The Germans managed to put inexperienced soldiers from the
          Hitlerjugend and Volkssturm units. <br>
          <br>
          Background <br>
          <br>
          In the last months of WW2, the Polish 2nd army, under general Karol Świerczewski, took part in the Soviet
          drive on Berlin. They were part of the Marshal Ivan Konev's 1st Ukrainian Front. The Poles operated in the
          centre and was flanked by the Soviet 5th Guards army on the right, and the 7th mechanized Corps to the left. <br>
          <br>

          <br>

          Against the Polish forces was the 4th Panzer Army, under general Fritz-Hubert Gräser of Ferdinand Schörners
          Army group Center. <br>
          <br>

          Fritz-Hubert Gräser <br>
          <br>
          April 17th, the Polish 2nd army breached the defenses of the Germans around Weisser Schöps and Neisse. The 2nd
          Polish army's pursuit of the retreating German forces pushed the Germans towards Dresden, and in turn,
          threatened to cut off additional forces in the Muskauer Forst region. The heavy pursuit after the Germans was
          a success. On 18 and 19 April, parts of the 2nd Polish army (the 8th Infantry Division and 1st Armored Corps)
          engaged the Germans and pushed them back while the remaining 5th, 7th, 9th and 10th Infantry Divisions pushed
          into Dresden. This made it possible to destroy the remaining Germans in the Muskauer Forst. <br>
          <br>
          The 20th of April was another successful attack, but this time by the 7th mechanized corps caotures parts of
          Bautzen, and trapping several German formations as well. <br>
          <br>
          Battle <br>
          <br>
          On 21 April, a big gap had formed due to the Pollish 1st armored Corps pushing towards Dresden and the
          infantry units (8th and 9th infantry Divisions) as well as the Polish units that which was securing the
          Muskauer Forst region. <br>
          <br>
          The 7th and 10th infantry Divisions were engaged near Neisse and the 5th infantry Division as well as the 16th
          tank brigade were in transit between those two groups of 7th and 10th. <br>
          <br>
          The Polish unit was stretched over a line of 50 kilometers which the Germans new all about and took the
          opportunity presented to them and pushed hard into the gap that was made between the Polish 7th and 10th
          infantry Divisions.<br>
          <br>
          The 21 of April marked the beginning of the battle of Bautzen. In the west the 20th Panzer Division started to
          move forward on Bautzen, while the 17th infantry Division to the east advanced on Niskey and Weißenberg. Along
          the way was still pockets of Germans trapped by the advancing Polish army and the Germans freeing a number of
          trapped Germans and adding them to the offensive that was on its way. <br>
          <br>
          The Germans pushed in between the Polish 2nd army and the Soviet 52nd army that was located around Bautzen, 40
          kilometers North East of Dresden and 25 kilometers west of Görlitz sweeping Soviet units a long the way. <br>
          <br>
          Polish general Świerczewski continued with his attempt to take Dresden, but made it worse and the growing
          chaos was now spreading to the entire Polish army, as many communication lines were cut.<br>
          <br>
          The Germans succeeded to link up with what was left of the troops in Maskauer Forst, and managed to throw the
          Polish and the Soviet forces into chaos.<br>
          <br>
          The Polish 2nd army split itself into 4 different groups and many found themselves surrounded by Germans. The
          worst was for the 5th infantry Division and 16th tank brigade, as they were struck in the rear, suffering
          severe losses. Especially the 16th tank brigade. The unit was almost annihilated, losing over 90 percent of
          its personnel and only 100 managed to survive.<br>
          <br>
          The retreating Soviet and Polish units in a small village of Niederkaina, which is today a part of Bautzen,
          set a barn on fire, which contained between 196 and 300 captured German members of the Volkssturm.
          <br>

          The Volkssturm, the last third Reich militia <br>
          <br>
          Świerczewski haltered his forces that was advancing to Dresden and ordered to pull back and secure the breach
          the Germans had effectively used. The 22nd of April he ordered the 1st armored Corp to change direction to
          abandon Dresden and instead support the center. The 8th infantry was also recalled but the 9th was remained
          near Dresden.<br>
          <br>
          The lack of communication made marshal Konev angry and Świerczewski was relieved of his command for
          incompetence. Marshal Konev ordered eight divisions from the Ukrainian front to reinforce the Polish
          positions, to stabilize the situation. <br>
          <br>
          The German attack to the southeast of Bautzen was a success. And at the same time, the 20th Panzer division
          was able to attack the trapped units in the south of Bautzen. Coordinations with the trapped Germans inside
          Bautzen made it possible to break into the town. A quick assembled Polish counter attack was without a success
          and resulted in recapturing of the whole Bautzen after several days of bloody house to house combat. During
          the next day's several pockets of resistance was cleared by the victorious German troops. Outside the town of
          Bautzen, the German advance stalled, because of the lack of fuel and supplies. <br>
          <br>
          The recapture of Bautzen was one of the last successful German tactical victories on the Eastern Front.
